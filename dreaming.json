H is a huge gathering of people and everyone seems to know everyone. They are all just arriving for what i dont know. I get in a truck with a couple of them and we head the opposite way than the park and i ask where we are going, they say we are playing a game. I look behind and notice no one is following, someone mentions we are winging. I notice a sign that pops up on the right, pointing to naropa cemetery. WE go in. I get the feeling it is a place where all of our graves are, yet i cant see if our death dates are on there. I thought it might be interesting to know, and there is this creepy vibe too. There are some kids in there too, we exchange glances i Ive them a quick glance. Next i go into this comic book store, with grant morrison. The lady working there i can hear talking to him, he must know her. She has left a book out for him, thinking he wanted it since he looked at it last time. Hes not that interested but I am, There is a weird pattern around the door, that allows people to transport to and from this place. very magical. But the time i want to leave it wont work for me. It had had before but wont this time.Im at a school, where there is a flying lotus show. It just got over and i go up and talk to him. I praise him for a bit, but i dont get much reaction, though he is attentive. And then i ask how he does it, and if he had some tips. He gets excited that i want to learn, and i tell him i have been trying. He tells me something about the levels, of the music, that it has to be turned up on the preamp first. i didnt quite get it and asked him what he meant. We are now asking outside, i think we are in denver. He says he just wants to edit or wants me to edit i feel. Then he takes off running, like a dog trying to catch a squirrel but its actually a bird. It’s so funny. Then i have to hurry up to catch up with him. I ask him what his plans are for the night, He says hes goin out in denver and what bout me? I tell him i have class at 9 that i need to go to, he respects that and i think it ends."

She asks if he made the dent on the side and Im not sure what he says but he says he noticed a crack on the windshield with blood. We go pick up the van and i remember that we had done this earlier and he followed or maw maw followed us while we made it home. It doesnt have any license or registration so its kinda dangerous. Also there are a couple of guns that we shouldnt have either. i notice the crack and blood and the window is a little foggy. Chris tells me that we are supposed to have 3 backroad routes. I pull out of the parking lot, nervous for some reason, probably the guns and no license. When i cross the opposite lane of traffic, i barely make it past a semi. Then i realize it’s a one way street, i turn around and meet up with chris. I end up at this weird place, charlie is there, we are having to answer these questions or something and he asks to see this other guys shirt. Not sure why.

In fact there is an air condition in the tent. I feel comfortable and have my iPod in my ear, listening to yoshimi battles the pink robots, because the drugs have taken their toll. The tent moves shapes, the patterns on be roof swirl and collide. Everything is in flux. Nothing is still. Everything is moving. I walk out of the tent and notice the swirl of the grass, and the curve of the ground. I can notice the curve of the sky and the swirl of clouds and the curvature of the earth all seem to swirl like clockwork. Nothing stops, everything is moving. I can feel the rotation of the earth and I balance myself. Everything is moving. My thoughts are moving. I can see people moving and getting up for he morning. The clouds move, the birds sing and fly. Everything is moving, nothing stays the same. My mind tries to stick to one thought, to define a moment or an instant but it moves and changes with everything else. I cant define the present, for it becomes the past. Every molecule of me moves. Nothing the same as it just was a moment ago. Nothing can be defined for it limits what it is now and what it can become. All that is reliable is mystery and movement. I move to the shower and shower. I wash everything of me. I rearrange the atoms of my body with the heat of water and movement of my body. Nothing is the same, and nothing is stuck, so I can influence it how I want. I can change any bit of it. The sore on my body will pass. I know this, for everything does. To define it would demean it. For it to remain mystery allows it to move. Mystery can be allowed to change. It is given room to change. Solidity and definition lack freedom. They have a certain path and purpose. Mystery and chaos surrounds me, and encompasses me."

There are so many cool designs, I am impressed. i check out a couple but want them to fit right. I also see some of the opening bands shirts. There are also so aqua teen shirts that are there from some other previous event. I got to watch Radiohead when they come on, the venue is very small and intimate. The stage is bare and there is another guy singing with Thom Yorke just hangie in in the back. i get the feeling they are testing out other new members, because i think Thom Yorke is quitting but the rest of the band wants to continue. I dont like the new guy, he doesnt fit at all. Then Im with my mom and sister in this town i dont know, kinda close to the coast i think, like LA. We are going to pay this weird lawyer some money to get dad out. reminds me of the lawyer from breaking bad. We go into this old store, like a thrift store for old people. we go up some stairs and at the end of the hall is the office. i am joking the whole time, and then we see angie, in this ugly green dress. It is old and she is trying to look fancy for some reason. My mom and sited know her i think. Then i am with Amanda on a couch as i wait for my mom. we talk and i i ask her about a flylo show and she tells me she saw it with her boyfriend and then thinks that i am upset and that i shouldnt have asked her that. I tell her i am cool and dont care really. Then we are at my uncle mangos house but it isnt his house. he is there and we are waiting for my aunt diana to show up. She is coming with my cousin Flying Lotus. She shows up first and there are mingo’s friends on the front lawn with her. Then Flylo shows up and i am trying to help him find parking in this horribly organized parking lot of my uncles. Reminds me of one Ive seen recently…cant remember. He parks in a spot i dont see and asks if Ive never done this before, i tell him no. i am giddy like when angelo would come as a kid. We are in the living room of this house, me on avouch sometimes with amanda. Fly lo shows us radiohead tickets, and i am like cool, maybe amanda will want to come too. Flylo makes sure he tells me that they arent free. Then he has all these like cardboard boxes that i think are games, and he wants to give them out to us. There are some other guys there too and a girl. He asks us who changed the name of the opening bands album to II with its new release. one guys answers one company i say Epic and then joke that we can just go through all the companies. and then Im like cause surely they didnt do it, o wait it was them wasnt it. Fly lo gives me the price and its one of their albums in awesome packaging. reminds me of Kid A limited but is bigger and all these things and pictures. There is this song called Milk and something on tone of the other albums that the people in the room are talking about. This cd is also 2 volumes. About two topics. at the end of the packing is this place where you can input your characters of a band, like who is the magician, the… the…. pretty cool idea. Then i think its over."

I remember asking this one girl out. Then stop caring. Another points out that that is the next step, to not care, making them want it more. I have some party item on hold at a store that I realize I wont get, since its 1216 and they close at 1230. I decide ill get it later and we can trip in my room. I speak of this room as a school.

I almost say something, the fact that I am on her bed again, but she seems to be ok with it so i dont say anything. Alaya is there and we cuddle and then i move him over. Like a habit Amanda and I get under the covers. We both know what is happening, but I have doubts, though I still want to see what is going to happen. Perhaps it will be different i think. I get close and the first thing i become weary of is her smell, but its not bad. Then we kiss, slowly and gently, though as it increases I notice her teeth in the way, and they are sharp. I am not too into the kissing. At the moment i have this weird feeling. This feeling of shyness, i remember this from her. That was the feeling of kissing someone for the first time, this feeling of shyness and how do i kiss this person, can i kiss this person, is this going to be ok, i hope i am good etc etc. It goes through my mind as well. Judgment must be held off. Though there are those whom i kiss that is flawless, we just get it."

I think i kill my sister, or watch her die, and then she gets chopped up into vitas and put in a bag. Not sure if the orgy was part of it, but there is this huge orgy happening at a pool, and i see the girl Im with in the water, she is bleeding form her vagina. There is this whole feel of this dream that i cant quite explain. Unsettling, uneasy, like it cant last forever. Its short lived. Its disturbing as well. Well in the end, my step father shows up looking for my sister. He is integrating me, looking everywhere. Opening bags filled with bodies. There are other kids around too. A lady too, not sure if she is mine or not but it kind of feels like that. He asks me about her body, i say that i think the other guy took care of her, he asks where he is, i said that he is dead. He is relatively cool, but there is still this fear factor. Something about a gun as well…. Ends with us laying around i think, me him and some kids. I feel like Im losing their support.

There is music being played and all of a sudden I dont have my guitar in my hand but I have a red Gibson SG. I like it and it has all the strings when my tele didnt, but I still ask the guy next to me where my tele is. It was a strange feeling of being judged and not just playing music but wanting my guitar. I immediately just wanted to go with the flow and play with the guitar I had been given. He feeling changed from that point on and we were on the grown next to this piano. Playing it and want an Xlr cable to hook up my Microkorg to it but then I realize I dont even have it. Zach does this thing with this headset handheld mic thing and pushed it in my face...its playful though.This reminds of me of this one night in Austin when Josh Matt Zach and this other kid were all playing music at Matts. Matt was on bass Zach on drums josh on guitar and this other kid on piano I thinks I was singing, howling making these amazing sounds. Or what I thought was amazing. We also watched the last waltz that night. And played with a projector attached to a video camera. This amazing feedback loop that made for such a cool effect. The problem came later when hanging out with nick and Ben and Joe and this guy. He was stoked to play music again, but was much more proficient than I was. Nick wanted me to play the piano, putting some effect on it, me having no control, I hated that. Then the guy assumed it was the drugs, that was why we aged so well that night....I also remember this guy from later on maybe weak or months later in a robe, kinda drugged out vibe. I mean he was good and he and Matt jammed but there was something I didnt like...something turned me off and away and made me feel really self conscious about making music. I am really hard on myself and always assume that the music I am making is not creative enough or sounds like something else and maybe thats why I need someone else yet to add to it or give me some kind of feedback. But Im so nervous and dont want to be wrecked by it. Uhhhh so Im stuck...I stay stuck. Never moving because I am afraid of it.Our house had set on fire, the one on 41st. I was running away from it I was down the block. Not sure what happened but it was a very strange feel. Not sure how the fire started but I didnt want to be near the catastrophe...so I was down the street and in this church parking lot or something...cant remember much more"

I dance a sec, one of my friends does and i order an aperol spritz and talk to the bartender about it and he recommends an olive."

They get in the truck and the driver has a shotgun and they drive to the convenient store, the opposite way of downtown, and ram this gate thing made of barbwire, stretching the wire til it breaks. Then I’m like in the back of the truck. Then on the top and the guy is trying to shoot me. He doesn’t ever shoot me though though definitely does shoot real bullets. I miss them or they miss me. We stop and get out and i get the gun and i keep trying to cock it and shoot and he just taunts me, every time. Then gets scared kinda saying its a life shot now. But it isn’t and i still can’t. Then i start hitting him with the gun. at one point i wondered if i should wake up, but i didn’t. He hangs from this tree and i keep hitting him, but he knows i can’t hurt him, and i hit him in the balls and it does nothing and i think he has no parts. Then i look inside the house and there is a sexy woman and i realize it was the dude from earlier wife. I get the idea to go in and rape her. I go in, he tries to stop me or slow down, and i go up behind her, she looks at me, doesn’t say anything or try to stop and i start to take off her pants. Im gonna rape her. and then this whole story starts happening. Im not sure if i should. Im not sure how the story goes, There is all this dialogue. it keeps changing as if I’m writing it. I think about raping her and then about him killing me at the same time, then there are four of us at a table and we are all gonna have sex, and angie is there and the other girl is courtney then sonia. Then i am watching angie bent over making out with the girl. and i am telling pizza nick the story as if it has already happened and i am just retelling.Next i am in the bed in my maw maws house. I am there alone i think at first then with a girl, a girl cousin. We are talking and get close and snuggle, and it almost feels sexual and i kinda have the feeling that we could have sex, but i don’t want to cause she’s my cousin and that would be bad, but also its still kinda dream. The lights are all off in the house for some reason, o ya cause its night time. I ask her how old she is and she tells me 19 and then talks about leaving the next day to go somewhere, i want to catch ride with her and chris to get something from my dad. they act like they have to do something else and it might not work. O well. i get up in the middle of the night to pee, and realize that its all clogged up and that maw maw had told harry that they would fix it tomorrow. i feel like my paw paw is alive too. I go ingot he kitchen and harry is there, and he talks to me. he talks to me about him paying rent and i start to be like o shit, i have been living here for 3 years and haven’t paid rent yet. He is like getting onto me. He can talk fine too. I start feeling bad for it and then i go back to bed and then there is a knock on the door and it closes and i hear harry talking to maw maw about it being my dad trying to get a little bit of money and bringing dads over i guess to try to do it. Very strange. There is also this crazy bat in the dream, while she is telling me about a bat that attacked her the day before and i start to tell her of bat sonar and how they create their world around them through sound. Another I am trying to cut my hair but my thing stops working so i ask my mom if she has one, and she does, but its weird cause my step dad has one too but i can’t use it or something. When she goes to cut my hair she its it way to short, actually bales it in the back. ridiculous. But in the dream it was bad anyways. I had super long hair in the back. I think i run into somebody later and get made fun of."

They see u and their eyes light up and then they chase u, and you are supposed to run to some people so they can help u exorcise them. Well this happens to me. I am actually looking for he kids, and then i find them unexpectedly and they begin to chase me. Then I’m scared and i finally find everyone else, i think travis and angie are there, but they are all busy creating this thing, this weird alter with angie sitting on it. They don’t stop working but they do help me to exorcise the kids. Such a weird feeling too when i realize that it is self created, and when I’m free it seems so silly i was ever possessed at all.Also a dream i at Ria’s and Tim’s house.

We go down, and it seems there are these other there people checking it tout too. Val has this motion to let them pass so we do. They go down and we follow them into this apt. Its like 3 rooms, its weird, its like the guy who is renting it lives here too, or right outside the room. Or maybe he’s moving out, don’t know the whole sitch. Anyways we go ingot his one room, and i check to see if we can be load, by banging on the ceiling. We hear this person immediately running down the stairs, and it is this beautiful brunette. She’s not pissed or anything, i think just thought we needed something. I am stoked and am like ’sold’! Then Val leaves for a bit and its very strange and I’m hanging with these guys, and the are threatening me or saying that we have wands and I’m like naw bra these are brooms…don’t know why we have brooms…but we do. They seem stumped and i go out to find val. He is talking to this chick or leaving the chicks apt, and something happens, cause there are like 3 of them, and they are hot and kinda all over us. I say something and they kinda leave and it is this push and pull, as val is like, you ruined it, but the push and pull continues. I end up going into their house and its huge and there are more people, more woman and guys. I start talking to this one chick, and I’m not sure what i am saying but it is working and she’s more and more into me. I say something and this guy on the other couch tells me I’m gay. I say naw bra thats how you get laid…Just remembered that earlier i had said out loud to val, dude lets have all the girls, and they all heard me. Yet when i went down there i buttered them up again. So i say to the kid naw thats how you get laid, and try to cover myself up and say that you have to mean it as well. I look at her and its all good, but i still have to go find val now. I go upstairs and there is a bunk bed and on top of it i think is val but its not. Its carrie and some dude. I recognize her she recognizes me she jumps on me we are all yelling and shit, and she’s like you were a goody goody boy, blah blah woof woof I’m like naw….then we are on the bed, trying to maintain talking, so that the guy she was with thinks we are talking, but actually we are exploring each others body…Then he peaks down, sees whats going on, her on top of me, and is kinda pissed. She gets off and I’m like dude, we were just so excited to see each other, its been years, you understand. He kinda rears for a punch, then doesn’t, then does, then doesn’t, then tries, but i can stop him it seems. just by focusing on the punch and not giving into it i can stop it. Eventually i grab his hands and we are kind of wrestling, but I’m not worried at all. Then I’m not me anymore but looking in and we are sweaty rubbing each other intimately. Next i am in basta, and George is there. We are supposed to be setting pu the restaurant i think, but all the lights are off. I think i masturbate in the restaurant but don’t realize it til bait later, and am like o shit, did i do that? What the fuck is happening. I kinda snap too and realize i am in basta, i might lose my job if George saw me and tells on me, and that i need to prepare the restaurant cause nothing has been done. i go turn on the lights, freaking our thinking its 5, but when i look at a clock its only 406. I am relieved start putting down the chairs and george is cool with me"

But then I get situated and he starts pitching. I hit he ball 4-5 times all fouls just knocking the ball. I am starting to become more lucid and ready to hit it but the stick I am holding is a pool cue, I notice it at the last pitch, cause I nicked t with the end of the stick. Now Im holding the stick but the fat is in my hand. I hit the ball and get a base hit, pretty sure the guy tried to throw the ball at me.

I ask her what happened and they said they were smoking. I said what and see Angie super upset and grab her and hug her. She gets better and wants to go up to the street for some reason. I go with her. And now Im up here and its night time in a dangerous neighborhood. But i know how to get them away from me or keep them away, but they are possessed. Some of them i scream at and some need to be exorcized, like this one guy, so i do that for him, its very strange i just wing it and get it out, but at first i don’t. Then i think i meet up with angie or someone like her and we are looking for something, a remnant of a dead aunt or something. We are next to this house and the alarm or whatever tracker we have on us goes off. I think maybe we should kiss or something, and we do and its awesome, but that’s not it.

Then the girl I’m with finds this little map or something, and its a puzzle that has to be done in the room, the lady had laid it out perfectly to a grid to figure something out.

We go to the back room of this place and chris is showing my pawpaws van. its just a frame but he said they were keeping it here, its like the oldest van or something. It had a duck bill on the front too. Then chris is opening all these bags looking for something. Well one bag not all these bags. It seems like its paw paws stuff and he’s trying to find something. Im kinda worried we are gonna get caught but then again its our grandfathers belongings so, its gotta be cool. This lady comes by. She doesn’t want to go back to work so she chills with us for a second, hoping nobody sees her. Then some ladies come in from the back and she decides to go back to work.At a beach house kinda thing.

WE get outside to this parking lot, and there is this black guy next to a car, and then 3 other people in the distance at a car. We walk past and he grabs my leg, I’m on the ground, and he tells me to give him my wallet and not move. I quickly am like shit, what do i do? I think i turn to angie for advice and realize, naw i gotta figure this out. So i hesitate, don’t give him anything. Then i try to resist and he says he has a gun, but i think he’s lying. So i imagine what i could do, to hit him in the balls or something, or fight him and get away. I question the people that are watching this.I replay moments in my head as i awake, how to get out of the situation. It is like training."

I chime in and go on a rant about how it perpetuates a negative connotation toward homosexuals and everyone is a bit uneasy, though they know Im speaking the truth. I realized at the end as I say homosexuality isnt wrong, that I have hit a barrier. That belief isnt completely held true here. Dad says something about me being loud. And I say ya well you have to be loud for certain things like a man and millions others marching in dc. And sorry for being so in the room. And mike started it. So mike and I kinda pound, and my mom says something about finishing my wine hinting drunk. I put be beer on be table saying o dont need this. Then get up, and my dad is up And tries to cheer me with another beer as a weird peace offering and I got pissed he was about to drink. Chase him into the back where he is about to smoke. Offers me some. I dont smoke. Kind of a fight with a smashed glass of wine. It ends I think...actually I think the glass breaks first. Then the cheats. Then the weed and its over.So its night and Im near this water and there are these people searching for something. Looks suspicious I am with the birkholtz.

I go into the other room and play music with these people. Then this guy puts down a guitar and i ask if i can play. he says yes. Its hard in the dream, strange guitar, weird action.

All of these people i know and some that i don’t are fighting, kind of trying to get to the top of this building but a lot is happening outside on bannisters and railings.  I get to the point where I have this one guy to beat but i am pretty sure that i can’t.  I don’t face him head on but instead try to go around him. I touch the ground which should make me lose but it doesn’t i don’t think. i make it inside and she follows me in. My love. She is the goal.  So then we have a choice to go back into the void or reset or maybe they are the same thing. The rest of the night sleeping thats all i can think about. Is this reincarnation and resetting story of two lovers, trying and trying again to…i dunno. I have lost a lot of it, but it was kinda matrix, breaking out of programming, the cycle or loop of the program.."

The news reporter says that its just a  comet, very rare and that most people haven’t even seen one anyways.  Still sketch, Then im outside and a pencil shaped rocket crashes 5 feet from me head first in the ground. It has begun. Crashes start happening all over. Its terrifying cause all u can do is look up.  I go to the neighbors house to find the girl but they have turned hostile and protective with guns and now everyone is an enemy to them, I tell m family they are lost and we leave them.  Some ids run around with little gun things. Chaos ensues fast."

We are in the mountains and I look over at one of the other peaks and notice an avalanche starting to happen.  Me and 2 other guys in the car look and are pretty amazed. It gets bigger and bigger. I tell Matt to keep driving and stop looking cause well he wants to see also.  We continue to drive and then we actually get to the spot of the avalanche. It was on out path. We get to the exact spot and have to stop and wait for the landslide to stop falling. I am ready to just jump out  of the car when I notice that it might hit us. But it doesn’t. This one car gets completely covered but the guy is outside of it I think.  We drive bast the car, barely and the next turn is back into the city.  "

I dunno for what, nor who I am with but there is a newness to the city we are at. Maybe futuristic,. Definitely novel and I think clean? I am in a Classroom of sorts. studying.  But also in the water. Which is weird.  So I think I’m treading water this whole time, but then all of a sudden something happens. I go to the bottom and realize its not near where I thought it was, and that I have been underwater for a moment.  A while actually. I talk to the people around me and people have noticed but are trying to keep their cool as not to ruin the magic that we are all breathing underwater. And have been for a sec."

I start to speed up fast and I cant see. I am scared I am going to go out of control and hit something. But as the blur happens I am still ok.  I decide to purt the car into its lowest gear and I slow down. Unharmed.  I put the car in park, and the next thing i remember I am not in the car. I am walking the streets and i remember there being a girl."
